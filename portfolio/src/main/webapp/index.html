      <h1>About me!</h1>
      <p>Hi! I'm Nina. I'm a rising junior at Stanford University majoring in computer science. 
          I'm originally from North Carolina, where I live with my parents, sister, and dog. 
          In my free time, I enjoy doing puzzles, reading, and watching Netflix, particularly 
          funny shows like How I Met Your Mother.</p>

        <p> Below are some my favorite projects that I've worked on. </p>

        <h2> Past Projects </h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Software Engineering @ Matrix Capital Management (Apr 2020 - Jun 2020)
                <ul>
                    <li> I developed a web application that allows users to view changes to sales of 
                        various businesses in light of COVID-19.
                    </li>
                    <li> Using Flask and HTML, I created an API to represent and graph data of user-queried 
                        companies.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <li> Venture Capital Research @ Stanford University (Mar 2019 - July 2019) 
                <ul> 
                    <li> In this project, I used Python to investigate the effects of military funding on thousands of venture capital investments. 
                        </li>
                    <li> I cleaned and analyzed large datasets to create an efficient and accurate matching algorithm from possibly erroneous data.
                        </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li> Computer Science Research @ Duke University (Jun 2017 - Jan 2019) 
                <ul>
                    <li> I developed and implemented a Python algorithm to produce more efficient decisions than current field leaders. 
                        I mathematically represented decisions and opinions as coordinates on a Cartesian plane and computationally
                        modelled decision-making techniques. </li>
                        
                    <li> To share this and other findings, I co-authored my team's paper that was presented at the 
                        AAAI 2019 conference. </li>
                </ul>

            </li>
            
        </ul>
