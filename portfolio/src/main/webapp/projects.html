      <p>Below are some my favorite projects that I've worked on.</p>
      <h2>Past Projects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Software Engineering @ Matrix Capital Management (Apr 2020 - Jun 2020)
          <ul>
            <li>I developed a web application that allows users to view changes to sales of 
                        various businesses in light of COVID-19.</li>
            <li> Using Flask and HTML, I created an API to represent and graph data of user-queried 
                        companies.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Venture Capital Research @ Stanford University (Mar 2019 - July 2019) 
          <ul> 
            <li>In this project, I used Python to investigate the effects of military funding on thousands of venture capital investments.</li>
            <li>I cleaned and analyzed large datasets to create an efficient and accurate matching algorithm from possibly erroneous data.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Computer Science Research @ Duke University (Jun 2017 - Jan 2019) 
          <ul>
            <li>I developed and implemented a Python algorithm to produce more efficient decisions than current field leaders. 
                        I mathematically represented decisions and opinions as coordinates on a Cartesian plane and computationally
                        modelled decision-making techniques.</li>                
            <li>To share this and other findings, I co-authored my team's paper that was presented at the 
                        AAAI 2019 conference.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>           
      </ul>
      <p>Languages: Python, C++, C, SAS</p>
